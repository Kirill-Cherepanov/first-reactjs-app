# My first published react project

Also this is the first project where I implement hero section. Although it has some drawbacks, the website itself looks so much better with it.

Beside that the website itself is very simple having only 2 sections, header and footer. That's why I made it without breaking it into commits.

Here it is deployed: https://kissmyussr.github.io/my-first-react-js-website-with-hero-section/#/
